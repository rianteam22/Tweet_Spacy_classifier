# Text Classification using SpaCy

This repository contains code for performing text classification using SpaCy, a popular natural language processing library in Python. The goal of this project is to classify text data into two categories: "FELIZ" (happy) and "TRISTE" (sad). This classification is based on the sentiment of the text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- String
- SpaCy
- Seaborn
- Numpy

You can install these libraries using pip.

Additionally, you will need to download the Portuguese SpaCy model. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download pt_core_news_sm
